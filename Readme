Explanation of work done by various code files - 

1)myProject.m - main file, calls all the functions
2)datasetter.m - builds image data matrix for cropped yale dataset
3)datasetterfull.m - builds image data matrix for full-face yale dataset
4)dsharvard.m - builds image data matrix for harvard data subsets
5)pca.m - calculates error rate for eigenvalue method for yale dataset using 'leaving one out' method
6)mypca.m - calculates error rate for eigenvalue method for harvard subsets
7)ldapca.m - called by 'fisherfaces.m' to apply PCA before applying LDA
8)lda.m - applies LDA and returns Wlda
9)fisherfaces.m - calls 'ldapca.m' and 'lda.m' to return W = Wpca * Wlda
10)ffharvard.m - calculates error rate for fisherface method for harvard subsets

-'imgs' folder contains cropped yale dataset (15 persons, 11 images each), individual images have been renamed for simplicity.
-'yalefaces' folder contains full-face yale dataset (15 persons, 11 images each), individual images have been renamed for simplicity.
-'subsets' folder contains harvard dataset divided into 5 subsets based on their illuminations.
